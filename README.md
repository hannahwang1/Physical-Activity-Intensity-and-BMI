# Exploring the Effect of Physical Activity Intensity on Enhancing the Individual’s Weight Status (BMI) in the New York City  

## Datasets

•	Cross-sectional data were obtained from the NYC Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NYC HANES) posted as publicly available datasets on the NYC Health website. The survey included a probability sample of 1999 non-institutionalized adult New York City residents with a response rate of 55%. 

•	The NYC HANES is a population-based, cross-sectional study with data collected from a physical examination, clinical and laboratory tests, as well as a face-to-face interview and an audio computer-assisted self-interview. 

## Lessons Learned

•	Multiple linear regression was conducted to examine the impact of the frequency of physical activity on the individual’s BMI, controlling for the effect of age groups, gender, and race. 

•	Secondary data analysis was conducted using two sample t-test to explore the association between the intensity of physical activity and the individual’s BMI.
