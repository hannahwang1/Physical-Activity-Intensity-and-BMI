# Exploring the Effect of Physical Activity Intensity on Enhancing the Individual’s Weight Status (BMI) in the New York City  

Through conducting a retrospective review of NYC HANES data, this study explored the assoication between the level of physical activity and BMI variation. Despite the growth of the current literature, there are many aspects of physical activities and its influence on weight status that remains to be explored. Previous studies have suggested the possible association between physical activities and reduced body weight, but they did not present compelling evidence for the relationship between different intensity of physical activity and BMI variation.The purpose of this study was to address the gap in the literature by examining the effectiveness of vigorous activity and moderate activity on enhancing one’s individual's BMI and weight status in NYC.

## Datasets

•	Cross-sectional data were obtained from the NYC Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NYC HANES) posted as publicly available datasets on the NYC Health website. The survey included a probability sample of 1999 non-institutionalized adult New York City residents with a response rate of 55%. 

•	The NYC HANES is a population-based, cross-sectional study with data collected from a physical examination, clinical and laboratory tests, as well as a face-to-face interview and an audio computer-assisted self-interview. 

## Lessons Learned

•	Multiple linear regression was conducted to examine the impact of the frequency of physical activity on the individual’s BMI, controlling for the effect of age groups, gender, and race. 

•	Secondary data analysis was conducted using two sample t-test to explore the association between the intensity of physical activity and the individual’s BMI.

• Findings based on survey data are limited by self-reported bias and loss to follow up; therefore, further study should explore the effect of physical activity on the individual’s BMI with the presence of other health indicators that influence weight status. 	

•	Findings represent citywide estimates for NYC about intensity of physical activity and its influence on BMI scale to suggest effective physical activity interventions and improvement for BMI management.

•	Understanding benefits of exercise intensity provides evidence for intervention design for weight control purposes.
